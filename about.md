# About Me
I recently finished my PhD from University of Kassel.
I was working with the group of Theoretical Computer Science/Formal Methods 
in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kassel. 
I was working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Martin Lange. 

My PhD research  is in the field of automata theory and formal verification,
however in my free time I enjoy working with data analysis and do some
application of deep learning.

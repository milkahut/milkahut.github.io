# About Me
I obtained my PhD from University of Kassel.
I was in the group of Theoretical Computer Science/Formal Methods 
in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kassel
led by Prof. Dr. Martin Lange. 

My PhD research  is in the field of automata theory and formal verification.
In my free time I enjoy working with data analysis and explore further
application of deep learning.

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I recently finished my PhD from  University of Kassel. 
		I was a working with the research group: Theoretical Computer Science/Formal Methods 
		in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kassel,
		led by Prof. Dr. Martin Lange.</p>
	
	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>Here is some projects I have made during my free time (mostly related to data analysis  and deep learning) and 
		during my PhD research (mostly related to automata theory and model-checking)</p>
	
	<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
	<p>I build a model that read in movie reviews from IMDB and make prediction whether
		it has positive or negative sentiment. I use recurrent neural network (RNN) 
		that also employs long short-term memory (LSTM). This make the model  does not only consider
		individual words, but also the order they appear in. I have trained  the model 
		on 25.000 reviews. </p>
	
	<h3>Flower Classifier </h3>
	<p>I build a model that take a flower image and classify it over 102 types of flowers. 
		I consider the 102-Oxford Flower dataset that is available here. In order to have a high accuracy,
		I used a pre-trained neural network ResNet152  and create a very deep model, i.e. >150 layers. 
		I then use google cloud service that allows us to use its GPU computation using
		Tesla K80 to train the model and obtain 91% accuracy.</p>
	
	<h3>Handwritten-digit Recogniser </h3>
	<p>I build a model that recognise a handwritten digit using simple multiple layer perceptron technique. 
		I  train the model on MNIST dataset which is available here and obtain 80% accuracy.</p>
	
	<h3>Multi-Letter Simulation Game</h3>
	<p>Together with my supervisor and the lead researcher in our group, we extend the framework of simulation
		game that is used to approximate language inclusion between two BÃ¼chi automata into Multi-Letter
		simulation game. This extended framework may  outperform  the  most  advanced 
		Ramsey-based algorithms by two orders of magnitude. The result of our research is documented here
		and the completed tool that we have build is available here. </p>

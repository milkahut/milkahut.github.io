	<p>Here is some projects I've made</p>
	
	<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
	<p>I build a model that read in movie reviews from IMDB and make prediction whether
		it has positive or negative sentiment. Use a recurrent network so the model does not only consider
		individual words, but also the order they appear in.</p>
	
	<h2>Flower Classifier </h2>
	<p>I Build a model that take a flower image and classify it over 102 types of flowers. Employ a 
		pre-trained neural network ResNet152 and produce a deep model with >150 layers. Use google
		cloud service to train the model and obtain 91% accuracy.</p>
	
	<h2>Handwritten-digit Recogniser </h2>
	<p>I build a model that recognise a handwritten digit using multiple layer perceptron technique. 
		Train the model on MNIST dataset and obtain 80% accuracy.</p>
